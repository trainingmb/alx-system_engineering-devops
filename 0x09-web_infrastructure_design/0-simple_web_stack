- **www Record in www.foobar.com:**
  - The www DNS record is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record pointing to foobar.com.
  - It serves as an alias for the domain foobar.com, directing traffic to the same IP.

### 4. Web Server (Nginx)

- **Role:**
  - Serves as the entry point for incoming HTTP requests.
  - Handles static content delivery.
  - Manages SSL termination if needed.
  
### 5. Application Server

- **Role:**
  - Executes the application code.
  - Handles dynamic content generation.
  - Interfaces between the web server and application code.

### 6. Database (MySQL)

- **Role:**
  - Stores and manages data used by the application.
  - Allows for data retrieval and storage operations.

### 7. Communication with User's Computer

## Issues with the Infrastructure

### 1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

- **Problem:**
  - The entire infrastructure relies on a single server (8.8.8.8).
  - If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

### 2. Downtime during Maintenance

- **Problem:**
  - Any maintenance requiring a web server restart will result in downtime.
  - Users won't be able to access the website during this period.

### 3. Scalability Challenges

- **Problem:**
  - The current setup may struggle to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic.
  - Scaling options, such as load balancing and multiple servers, are not considered in this basic infrastructure.
